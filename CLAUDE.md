## Backlog Workflow

This project uses the LeanVibes backlog workflow.

When identifying work that could be deferred, present a backlog suggestion box.
Suggest adding to backlog when:
- Work is tangential to the main task
- It's an enhancement rather than a requirement
- It would significantly expand scope
- The user mentions "later" or "eventually"
- You identify technical debt or optimization opportunities
