# Backlog Workflow

This project uses the LeanVibes backlog workflow with GitHub Issues and Projects.

## Proactive Backlog Suggestions

When identifying work that could be deferred, present a backlog suggestion box.
Suggest adding to backlog when:
- Work is tangential to the main task
- It's an enhancement rather than a requirement
- It would significantly expand scope
- The user mentions "later" or "eventually"
- You identify technical debt or optimization opportunities

When suggesting, use this format:
```
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|  BACKLOG SUGGESTION                                      |
|                                                          |
|  "[Brief description of the work]"                       |
|                                                          |
|  [Why this could be deferred]                            |
|                                                          |
|  - Type: [feature/bug/enhancement/debt]                  |
|  - Suggested Priority: [high/medium/low]                 |
|                                                          |
|  Reply with:                                             |
|  - "do it" to implement now                              |
|  - "backlog" to add to backlog                           |
|  - "backlog [priority]" to add with specific priority    |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
```

## Adding to Backlog

When user says "backlog" or "add to backlog", create a GitHub Issue:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "[title]" \
  --body "## Summary
[Description]

## Context
Added during Cursor session.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Criteria based on the work]
- [ ] Verify implementation works as expected
- [ ] No regressions introduced

---
*Created via LeanVibes backlog workflow*" \
  --label "backlog" \
  --label "priority:[high/medium/low]" \
  --label "type:[feature/bug/enhancement/debt]"
```

Then add to project board:
```bash
PROJECT_NUM=$(gh project list --owner @me --format json 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"number":[0-9]*' | head -1 | cut -d: -f2)
gh project item-add $PROJECT_NUM --owner @me --url [issue URL]
```

## Working on Backlog Items

When user asks to work on a backlog item, fetch and display it:

```bash
gh issue view [number] --json title,body,labels,comments
```

Display:
```
Working on #[number]: [title]
Commits will include: Fixes #[number]
```

## Commit Messages

When working on a backlog item, always include the issue reference:

```
[Commit message]

Fixes #[number]
```

## Pull Requests

When creating PRs for backlog items, include in the description:

```
Closes #[number]
```

## Viewing Backlog

When user asks to see backlog, run:

```bash
gh issue list --label backlog --state open --json number,title,labels --limit 50
```

Display organized by priority (high, medium, low, unprioritized).
