# Example Project: AuthFlow

This folder contains a sample project to help you practice the LeanVibes backlog workflow.

## What's Here

- **requirements.md** - A fake project spec for a simple authentication system
- Sample tasks you can add to your backlog
- Stretch goals designed to trigger backlog suggestions

## How to Use

1. **Setup LeanVibes** in a test repo (run the setup script)
2. **Install your tool's config** (Claude Code, Cursor, or Copilot)
3. **Open requirements.md** and follow the walkthrough
4. **Practice the workflow** - add items, work on them, see suggestions

## The Goal

Get comfortable with:
- Adding backlog items quickly
- Pulling items from backlog to work on
- Recognizing when AI suggests deferring work
- Committing with issue references
- Watching issues auto-close

## Tips

- You don't need to actually build the auth system
- Focus on the workflow, not the code
- Try scope creep - mention "we should also add X" and see what happens
- Practice saying "backlog" or "backlog medium" when suggestions appear
